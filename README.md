# Basket Market Analysis task at Ubiqum (2017)

Assignment to introduce the students the **association rules** and the most important concepts about this topic, such as **confidence**, **support** and **lift**. Usage of the *arules* library of R.

One of my first codes in R; some years later I realize the poor quality of the code written. I admit that those days I was completely focused on learn new concepts about data analytics rather than create good code.
